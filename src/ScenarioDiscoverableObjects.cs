/// The module schedules periodic "spawn checks" while the game clock is running, at an interval 
/// set by spawnInterval. At each spawn check, any asteroids that have gone untracked for too long 
/// are removed from the game.
/// 
/// To add an element of randomness, only a fraction of checks (controlled by spawnOddsAgainst) 
/// have a chance to produce asteroids. No asteroids are produced if the number of untracked 
/// asteroids already in the game exceeds spawnGroupMaxLimit. Because spawn checks happen 
/// very frequently, the number of detected asteroids in a game where the player never 
/// tracks an asteroid will almost always be close to spawnGroupMaxLimit.
/// 
/// The timing of spawn checks appears to be independent of the warp rate, but at high time warp 
/// multiple asteroids may be spawned per check. (Needs confirmation)
/// </remarks>
