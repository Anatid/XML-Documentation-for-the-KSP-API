### About this project

This is community-generated documentation for the KSP API. It has been
assembled through the efforts of 
[a number of people](https://github.com/Anatid/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/graphs/contributors). 
If you want to contribute, read the instructions at
[the Github project](https://github.com/Anatid/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API#how-to-contribute-to-this-documentation). 

### Where to start

Probably the best place to start browsing this documentation is the 
[class list](http://anatid.github.io/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/annotated.html).

### Documentation in your IDE

You can download an XML documentation file that will integrate this documentation
with Visual Studio or MonoDevelop. Download 
[Assembly-CSharp.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anatid/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API/master/Assembly-CSharp.xml)
and place it next to Assembly-CSharp.dll in the KSP_Data/Managed folder. Now
VS or MonoDevelop will show the documentation in tooltips and in the object browser.

### What to do when the documentation is incomplete

1. Look at the source code of a mod that does something similar to what you are trying to do.

2. Look through Assembly-CSharp.xml in the object browser and see if you can find any classes
with likely-sounding names. Then try them out. This is how this documentation was put together in
the first place.

3. Once you learn how to use a class or member that's not documented here, you should 
contribute your new-found knowledge to make the documentation better. See the instructions
for how to to help [here](https://github.com/Anatid/XML-Documentation-for-the-KSP-API#how-to-contribute-to-this-documentation).
